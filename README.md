Clean Architecture for node.js projects


## ❯ Getting Started

### Step 1: Set up the Development Environment

You need to set up your development environment before you can do anything.

Install [Node.js and NPM](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

- on OSX use [homebrew](http://brew.sh) `brew install node`
- on Windows use [chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/) `choco install nodejs`

### Install

- Install all dependencies with `yarn install`

### Running in dev mode

- Run `yarn start` 
- The server address will be displayed to you as `http://0.0.0.0:3000`

### Building the project and run it

- Run `yarn build` to generated all JavaScript files from the TypeScript sources.
- the builded app located in `dist`.
